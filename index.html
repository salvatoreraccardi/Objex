                    <p class="p">
                        my name is Salvatore Raccardi (yep, I'm Italian), I'm the founder of Objex.<br/>
                        I am 20 years old and live in Palermo, a city in southern Italy.<br/> 
                        I have a diploma in electronics. I currently attend engineering at the University of Palermo.<br/><br/>

                        Are you wondering which strange website you ended up in?<br/>
                        Objex for me is a box where I keep all my projects. <br/>
                        You may be wondering why grouping all my projects under one name (Objex).<br/>
                        Because, all my projects have a common denominator â†’ IoT (Internet of things).<br/><br/>

                        Why IoT?<br/>
                        I firmly believe that the future of humanity will depend on this simple acronym.<br/>
                        Behind the IoT there are several technologies such as AI (artificial intelligence), Big data, Robotics and many others.<br/>
                        IoT will have a more powerful impact than the Internet.<br/><br/>

                        My goals?<br/>
                        First of all, I want to expand my knowledge. And finally I want to share my ideas with the world (click to open my YouTube channel).<br/>
